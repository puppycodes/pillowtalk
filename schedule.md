<br><br>

<p>A lay of the land of the laid!​ During this introductory mixer, we’ll ask and answer questions like, W​hat are our current turn ons and hang ups? What private pleasures do we seek to fulfill? What public actions would we like to endeavor? What are our visions of sexual utopia? ​This “soft launch” will serve as a brainstorm and foreplay for future programming.</p>


<p>Joining us will be model, filmmaker, journalist, and sex writer Tierny Finster activist A​lice Barker​ (​of ​support.fm)​; writer and ​sex educator​ A​na Cecilia Alvarez​; ​Psychotherapist (MFTI), and S​oulfriend Radio​ host G​aea Woods​;​ and stylist, flutist, the man who cast Eckhaus Latta’s pornographic ad campaign, ​Samuel Muglia.​</p>

We’d rather be free. This femme-centered consciousness raising session will address trends like celebrity rape and sexual abuse revelations, while asking personal-cum-political questions like: How do we get in abusive sexual dynamics in the first place? How is power seductive? How can we avoid future violations? What is consent? What are our desires? How can we distill fear and enjoy sex, amidst so much collective trauma? What are the ethics of “callout culture”? This group discussion will be facilitated with the help of ​trauma therapist and writer Larissa Pham; sex-ed instructor and writer Ana Cecilia Alvarez; artist Amalia Ulman; model and activist Alexandra Marzella; feminist pro-sex activist and pornstar Amarna Miller; and activist Alice Barker.

Many Waters:
<br>
A moving meditation on sexuality and the sacred. ​Many of the oldest metaphysical traditions teach us that the generative, sexual forces contained within all bodies are in fact our truest and most essential connection to the divine. Issues of emotional well-being, boundaries, intuition and intimacy can all be mapped to what the yogic traditions called the 2nd of Sacral Chakra, Svadhisthana, or “One's Own Place.” This 90-minute workshop, designed and led by ​Alexis Blair Penney,​ will focus on teasing out the connections between our most intimate selves and the way we engage with others and how awareness (or lack thereof) of the pelvic, sacral and surrounding areas in the physical body can expand and enhance those connections. We will work with yogic movement, breath, sound, and meditation in ways that are designed to be accessible to a broad range of experience, for both veteran movers and breathers and novices alike. Expect deep, watery flows, some powerful hip openers and an intuitive to care for yourself in a new way, with time for questions and discussion after.

Alexis Blair Penney is an artist, astrologer, sexual healer, and spirit and body worker who has been teaching movement for over 4 years. They are a CYT 240+ and have sat on faculty for over 10 yoga teacher trainings, including Hatha and Vinyasa styles, with extensive experience of Kundalini yoga and various forms of intuitive energy and movement work.
