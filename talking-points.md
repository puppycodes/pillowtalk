The following is the beginning of a series of communication tips we intend to keep in mind during our events. We’ll be adding to this document as the series proceeds, as we’re learning...

Talking Points

“If we could communicate, we wouldn’t need communication.”
—Avital Ronell

Mistakes will be made. Think of them as missed takes. Misunderstandings, miscommunications. Do you always say what you mean and mean what you say? At Pillow Talk, we encourage clarification, term defining, contextualizing, compassion, and forgiveness.

Don’t assume because someone uses words you know that you know what they mean. All words have connotations (personal and/or social ideas, feelings, and memories associated with them), as well as dictionary definitions. Often people’s associations with words are different, and this can result in conflict. An example: A young cis bisexual woman once referred to a new femme trans friend of hers as “dude,” as in, “What’s up dude?” This was a habit of speech the cis woman had adopted to seem cool and casual, like Kristen Stewart, who often says “dude.” (The cis woman called all of her friends, even her parents, “dude.”) The trans friend was triggered, however, and understandably, by the label, given her personal history; not identifying with the male sex, but being labeled it at birth. When the trans woman confronted her cis friend about her hurtful use of the word “dude,” the cis friend felt awful and inconsiderate, but this proved to be an opportunity to communicate a truth until then unspoken, which was that, to the cis woman, her new friend was, “undeniably femme,” she’d only ever experienced her friend, “as a woman, and so I didn’t think… I’m sorry.” This share ended up reaffirming the femme friend’s identity. The experience also prompted the cis bisexual girl to introspect on her discomfort and dissociation with her own femininity! Language is often awkward. Real apologies feel amazing.

Harm reduction is a set of practical strategies and ideas aimed at reducing the negative consequences of risky human behaviors, including driving, drug use, and sexual activity. Seatbelts and speed limits, as well and condoms and lubes, are classic examples of a harm reduction tools. At Pillow Talk, we believe that harm reduction can be applied to communication too. Words can change lives: harm, trigger, and traumatize. They can also heal, educate, and incite belonging and love. Recognizing the power of your words—the impact of the language we use—is a first step to reducing its potential harm and sharing well-being instead. Avoiding labels, name calling, and binary language may be a harm reduction tactic. Or, try reflecting on how you’ve been hurt by words, and what kind of communication you’d like to have received instead. (The meaning of “kind,” psychoanalyst Adam Phillips suggests, is to recognize we are of the same kind.) Harm reduction can be applied to our inner voices, as well as to group discussion dynamics.

Some of us are more comfortable talking and taking up space than others. Please make space for shyness, that goes for the shy too—we’d love to hear from you, but you don’t have to. (In our experience, the quiet ones tend to be wise; when you’re not performing, you can really listen and reflect.)

No one has the same set of experiences and influences. In each individual, class, race, gender, sex, education, religion, talents, confidences, hobbies, zodiacs, disabilities and abilities, and histories of abuses, accolades, travel, genetics, and on and on intersect—uniquely. This is an asset and exciting; we are as diverse within ourselves as we are in relation to one another.

Language is communal and adaptative. We have, will, and can reinvent it.

Language is a tool. It can be used to dominate. To belittle or inflate. To lie, or to reveal, connect, relate… Language is our system of law; is astrology; is poetry; is jokes; memes; tweets; and compliments. We find it helpful to think about what purpose our language is serving. What we want to achieve with and through it? Hammer something in? Deflect? Ease? Comfort? Compartmentalize? Prove how smart we are? Make someone else feel good? Sell something? Consider: the shape, force, purpose, and effectiveness of your words, as well as those all around you.

You know how you can know what a pet or plant wants by how it looks, sounds, and moves? Humans are alive too! We can wilt, glow, whine, bark, cower, shake, and purr. At Pillow Talk, we intend to practice listening and responding to one another’s body language, that includes posture, vocal pitch, and tone, including our own—be mindful of it.

Cushions of silence can be thoughtful.

Intuition. Empathy. Telepathy. Clairvoyance. Prescience. That we have words for these concepts leads us to believe they exist.

Often the feelings come first; incoherent, chaotic, overwhelming, ineffable, instinct. Sometimes they distill into words, stories, a lesson, clarity. It’s good to make space for the feels to reveal themselves...

You know what’s a cool trick? Talking from different parts of your body. Feel into your heart, and try speaking from it. Do you mind, your eyes, throat, gut, loins...

Things aren’t black and white, but words on the page often are ;)
